k-nearest neighbor algorithm
Its all about calculating the distance between features and find the k nearest values to label the test data which needs to be classified
Pros - Relatively simple
Cons - Computationally intensive and slow as iterates over every training point
       Hard to represent relationships between features as just calculates the difference in one function. This will be a flaw if some features are more informative

In the long run we want a classifier that learns more complex relationships between features and the label we are trying to predict.
A decision tree and a neural network is a good example for that
