Classifier as a function. Takes data as input and labels a output.
Supervised learning - Create a classifier by finding patterns in the examples.

Simple recipe for Supervised learning

1.Collect Training Data
E.g. Take description as input.
(Weight Texture Label) - Training data
(Weight Texture) - Features or measurements which describe what we want to classify

2.Train Classifier
Simplest classifier is a decision tree based on bunch of if and else statement
Box of rules - classifier - I/p O/p can be made generic

3.Make Predictions
A learning algorithm is the procedure that creates the box of rules which in turn is the classifier.
It forms the rules by finding patterns in the training data
Like oranges might weigh more and so that might be a rule in the classifier to determine the type of fruit

Important Concepts
How does this work in the real world?
How much training data do you need?
How is the tree created?
What makes a good feature?
