Visualizing a decision tree

Many types of classifiers
1. Artificial neural network
2. Support vector machine


Goals for this video
1. Import dataset
2. Train a classifier
3. Predict label for new flower
4. Visualize the tree  #Dependency issues

Important thing to learn is how the trees are built automatically
