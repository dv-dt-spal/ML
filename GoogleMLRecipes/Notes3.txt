Why coming up with good features is one of the most important task in Machine Learning?
The classifiers will predict better with better features.

Ideal features for classifiers are
1. Informative - There should be difference in mode value of the labels/output based on the type of feature like
                 the eye color of dog as a feature is not useful as it may result in equal distribution of the targeted output
2. Independent - Two sets of features in the training data set should not correlate like height in different units
3. Simple - Classifier should be able to interpret it like miles vs lat long of 2 cities


Issues in the above might affect the classifiers accuracy.
